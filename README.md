# Group23-Frontend
Frontend for the software engineering module, the base template used for the frontend was from create-react-app and has been heavily modified to include redux.

### Installation
You will need to download & install Node (Version: 12.14.1 is the one it's know to work for)
You will need to have the files locally and run `yarn install` - you will need the yarn package manager for this, it can be downloaded through npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn), you will need to just run the command `npm i yarn -g`. Once you have downloaded all the libraries (it could take a while) you just use the command `yarn start` to open the dev environment. A new window in your browser should open and you will be able to access the code running.
